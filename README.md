## Building from source code
- Start a new command line prompt at this point to ensure you're using the updated PATH environment.
- Switch to an appropriate branch, if necessary.
- For development
  - `yarn install` to install dependencies
  - `yarn build` to build
  - `yarn start` to run
- For production
  - `yarn dist` to build (this will take a while)
  - Find the installer and an already unpacked version in dist
